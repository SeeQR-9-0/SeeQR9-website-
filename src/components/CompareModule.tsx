            The comparison table is flexible to the userâ€™s preferences as the
            user selects which queries to compare side by side.

            Simply check or uncheck the box next to each saved query to add or
            remove the query from the graph.
          </p>
          <p>
            Graph will be organized along the x-axis by group, and colored by
            schema.

          <p>
            Aside from the visualized performance comparison of the selected
            queries, a table will display information about each selected query,
            including its total run time and performance relative to other
            queries with the same label, with the most performant query
            highlighted.
